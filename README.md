# Data augmentation for low-resource GEC
<!-- We proposed data augmentation framework named GECDA for low-resource GEC to overcome the challenges of data sparsity and mismatch data distribution. Experimental results proved that GECDA increased the contribution of the source tokens to the decisions of the output which improved the performance of GEC. We investigated the performance of GECDA in Arabic GEC which outperformed the classical misspelling noising methods and the existing Arabic GEC systems. -->
